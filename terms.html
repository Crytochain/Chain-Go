          <h1><strong>13. Binding arbitration and class action waiver</strong></h1>
          <p>PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY – IT MAY SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS, INCLUDING YOUR RIGHT TO FILE A LAWSUIT IN COURT</p>
          <p><strong>13.1 Initial Dispute Resolution</strong></p>
          <p>The parties shall use their best efforts to engage directly to settle any dispute, claim, question, or disagreement and engage in good faith negotiations which shall be a condition to either party initiating a lawsuit or arbitration.</p>
          <p><strong>13.2 Binding Arbitration</strong></p>
          <p>If the parties do not reach an agreed upon solution within a period of 30 days from the time informal dispute resolution under the Initial Dispute Resolution provision begins, then either party may initiate binding arbitration as the sole means to resolve claims, subject to the terms set forth below. Specifically, all claims arising out of or relating to these Terms (including their formation, performance and breach), the parties’ relationship with each other and/or your use of the Service shall be finally settled by binding arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association in accordance with the provisions of its Commercial Arbitration Rules and the supplementary procedures for consumer related disputes of the American Arbitration Association (the “AAA”), excluding any rules or procedures governing or permitting class actions.</p>
          <p>The arbitrator, and not any federal, state or local court or agency, shall have exclusive authority to resolve all disputes arising out of or relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability or formation of these Terms, including, but not limited to any claim that all or any part of these Terms are void or voidable, or whether a claim is subject to arbitration. The arbitrator shall be empowered to grant whatever relief would be available in a court under law or in equity. The arbitrator’s award shall be written, and binding on the parties and may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction.</p>
          <p>The parties understand that, absent this mandatory provision, they would have the right to sue in court and have a jury trial. They further understand that, in some instances, the costs of arbitration could exceed the costs of litigation and the right to discovery may be more limited in arbitration than in court.</p>
          <p><strong>13.3 Location</strong></p>
          <p>Binding arbitration shall take place in New York. You agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of any federal or state court in New York County, New York, in order to compel arbitration, to stay proceedings pending arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate or enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator.</p>
          <p><strong>13.4 Class Action Waiver</strong></p>
          <p>The parties further agree that any arbitration shall be conducted in their individual capacities only and not as a class action or other representative action, and the parties expressly waive their right to file a class action or seek relief on a class basis. YOU AND MOACMask AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. If any court or arbitrator determines that the class action waiver set forth in this paragraph is void or unenforceable for any reason or that an arbitration can proceed on a class basis, then the arbitration provision set forth above shall be deemed null and void in its entirety and the parties shall be deemed to have not agreed to arbitrate disputes.</p>
          <p><strong>13.5 Exception - Litigation of Intellectual Property and Small Claims Court Claims</strong></p>
          <p>Notwithstanding the parties’ decision to resolve all disputes through arbitration, either party may bring an action in state or federal court to protect its intellectual property rights (“intellectual property rights” means patents, copyrights, moral rights, trademarks, and trade secrets, but not privacy or publicity rights). Either party may also seek relief in a small claims court for disputes or claims within the scope of that court’s jurisdiction.</p>
          <p><strong>13.6 30-Day Right to Opt Out</strong></p>
          <p>You have the right to opt-out and not be bound by the arbitration and class action waiver provisions set forth above by sending written notice of your decision to opt-out to the following address: MOACMask ℅ ConsenSys, 49 Bogart Street, Brooklyn NY 11206 and via email at <a href="mailto:info@moac.io">info@moac.io</a>. The notice must be sent within 30 days of September 6, 2016 or your first use of the Service, whichever is later, otherwise you shall be bound to arbitrate disputes in accordance with the terms of those paragraphs. If you opt-out of these arbitration provisions, MOACMask also will not be bound by them.</p>
          <p><strong>13.7 Changes to this Section</strong></p>
          <p>MOACMask will provide 60-days’ notice of any changes to this section. Changes will become effective on the 60th day, and will apply prospectively only to any claims arising after the 60th day.</p>
          <p>For any dispute not subject to arbitration you and MOACMask agree to submit to the personal and exclusive jurisdiction of and venue in the federal and state courts located in New York, New York. You further agree to accept service of process by mail, and hereby waive any and all jurisdictional and venue defenses otherwise available.</p>
          <p>The Terms and the relationship between you and MOACMask shall be governed by the laws of the State of New York without regard to conflict of law provisions.</p>
          <h1><strong>14. GENERAL INFORMATION</strong></h1>
          <p><strong>14.1 Entire Agreement</strong></p>
          <p>These Terms (and any additional terms, rules and conditions of participation that MOACMask may post on the Service) constitute the entire agreement between you and MOACMask with respect to the Service and supersedes any prior agreements, oral or written, between you and MOACMask. In the event of a conflict between these Terms and the additional terms, rules and conditions of participation, the latter will prevail over the Terms to the extent of the conflict.</p>
          <p><strong>14.2 Waiver and Severability of Terms</strong></p>
          <p>The failure of MOACMask to exercise or enforce any right or provision of the Terms shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. If any provision of the Terms is found by an arbitrator or court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, the parties nevertheless agree that the arbitrator or court should endeavor to give effect to the parties’ intentions as reflected in the provision, and the other provisions of the Terms remain in full force and effect.</p>
          <p><strong>14.3 Statute of Limitations</strong></p>
          <p>You agree that regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, any claim or cause of action arising out of or related to the use of the Service or the Terms must be filed within one (1) year after such claim or cause of action arose or be forever barred.</p>
          <p><strong>14.4 Section Titles</strong></p>
          <p>The section titles in the Terms are for convenience only and have no legal or contractual effect.</p>
          <p><strong>14.5 Communications</strong></p>
